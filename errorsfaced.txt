    ClassNotFoundException: 
    Initially, you encountered a ClassNotFoundException when trying to run your Spring Boot application. This error indicates
    that the JVM couldn't find a class that the application depends on. It can happen due to various reasons, such as missing 
    dependencies, incorrect classpath settings, or errors in the application code.

    Package Name Mismatch: 
    You noticed that the package name specified in your Java file (com.mahesh) didn't match the directory structure (com/mahesh).
    This discrepancy might not have caused the ClassNotFoundException directly, but it's a good practice to ensure consistency
    between package names and directory structures.

    Building and Running Docker Image: 
    After resolving the classpath issue, you attempted to build and run a Docker image for your application. While the image was
    successfully created and started, you encountered issues when accessing the application, suggesting potential problems with
    the container configuration or port mapping.

    Troubleshooting Docker Container: 
    Further investigation revealed that the Docker container was running, but you couldn't access the application as expected.
    This might indicate issues with networking, container configuration, or the application itself.

    Git Repository Creation: 
    You also asked about creating a Git repository in Linux and setting up a remote repository. This task wasn't directly related
    to the Spring Boot application issues but was part of your workflow for managing the application's source code.
